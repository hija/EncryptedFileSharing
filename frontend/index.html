  <h3>How it works</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>You select the file you want to upload.</li>
      <li>The file gets encrypted with a secure, random key ðŸ”’</li>
      <li>The encrypted file is uplaoded to the server. The server operator cannot see the contents of the file nor the file name, since it is encrypted.</li>
      <li>A download link is generated. The download link contains your secure, random key ðŸ”‘</li>
      <li>If you share your download link, the file is downloaded first and then decrypted locally. Again: Your key is never shared with us.</li>
  </ul>
